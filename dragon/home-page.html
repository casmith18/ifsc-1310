<h2>Dragon Vehicle Overview</h2>
  <p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting 
  destinations. Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in 
  history to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, 
  a feat previously achieved only by governments. It is the only spacecraft currently flying 
  that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Currently Dragon 
  carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. Under an 
  agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable Dragon to 
  fly crew. Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon" target="_blank">Learn more here!</a>

  <h3>Configurations:</h3>
  
  <h4>Cargo - Resupply the Space Station</h4>
      
      <ul>
          <li>DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES - Dragon is the first commercial 
          spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and 
          currently the only cargo spacecraft flying capable of returning significant 
          amounts of cargo to Earth. Dragon accommodates pressurized cargo in the 
          capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.
          </li>
          <li>VERSATILE CARGO RACKS - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction 
          designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment. They accommodate a 
          variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials 
          such as biological samples.
          </li>
      </ul>
  <h4>Crew - Taking Humans into Space</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA - Dragon was designed from the 
            outset to fly humans to space. Under an agreement with NASA, 
            SpaceX is making upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew carrying capability.
            </li>
          <li>CREW UPGRADES - Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reliable 
          crew transport vehicle, with seating for seven, life-support systems, 
          controls with manual capability, and a powered launch escape system.
          </li>
        <li>FIRST LAUNCH - Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. 
        Dragon’s first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.
       </li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>Dragon Lab - A FREE-FLYING MICROGRAVITY LABORATORY</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>FACILITATING RESEARCH - DragonLab is a free-flying, 
        unmanned platform designed for research and testing in a microgravity 
        environment independent of the International Space Station.
        </li>
        <li>LONGEVITY - It can transport payloads, experiments, instruments, and sensors into space
        and back to Earth on missions ranging from one week to two years.</li>
        <li>CAPABILITIES - DragonLab can readily accommodate instrument and sensor testing, space physics and relativity experiments, radiation effects research, and many other microgravity tests.</li>
     </ul>
