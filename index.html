 <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
 <p>Progressive enhancement can be considered one of the most important things in web design. Progressive enhancement allows the creator of a specific website to focus 
 more on the actual content rather than making the content for a specific engine or browser.
 Progressive enhancement allows everyone the basics of the content regardless of what browser or type of internet they are using. 
 This is incredibly important because it allows more people to connect to the creators content regardless of their hardware or software. To learn more about the specifics of progressive enhancement, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/" target="_blank">check this out!</a></p>
 <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
 <p>This SpaceX Dragon site project was different from any other assignment I have ever done. I initially went into this assignment very intimidated. I decided to try to take this assignment little by little and by doing that I was able to get the assignment finished and on time. I am not much of a designer so I don't think I did as well as I could have styling the page. The easy part of the assignment for me was the html. For some reason html is where I really shine, I feel like I know it very well. However I feel as if my css skills are not as well developed as my html skills. After receiving feedback on the first draft of the site, I decided to make some changes. People had commented that the white background of the sight was to hard on the eyes, so I changed it to light grey. They also pointed out that the text was sometimes to hard to read so I made the text darker all across the site. I tried to style the site a little more on the second go around and I feel as if I did a much better job this time.</p>
 <p>This semester went really great in my opinion. I am not joking when I say that this was the most fun I have had taking a class, and I am not just saying that trust me. The professor made things really easy to understand and I appreciate that. As I said before I feel as if html is my strong suit. I feel like I know it very well. If I had to go back in the semester I would spend more time with css so I could utilize it better. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and I would take it again if I could!</p>
